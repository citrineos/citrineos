For a description of the roles and responsibilities of the various members of the CitrineOS community, see the [governance policies].

## How to Contribute a Bug Fix or Change

To contribute code to the project, first read over the [governance policies] page to understand the roles involved.

Each contribution must meet the [TypeScript](.eslintrc.json) *coding style* (part of every repository) and include:

* Tests and documentation to explain the functionality.
* Any new files have [copyright and license headers]
* Submitted to the project as a pull request.

Each commit message and pull request description should have enough information in it so that other contributors can understand what has been changed and eventually which impact the change will have.

CitrineOS is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE.md) license. Contributions should abide by that standard license.

If you are unfamiliar with contributing to projects on Github, [here is a guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects).

Project committers will review the contribution in a timely manner, and advise of any changes needed to merge the request.
