See something here that you wish was happening sooner, say support for the **Local Authorization List Management** OCPP Certification Profile? Begin working on it! Let us know as well so we can support you and make sure multiple people aren't pursuing the same goals separately.

See something that's not here that you think should be? Let us know! Maybe there's a reason, maybe we haven't considered it and we'd love your input and help. This roadmap will grow and change with your feedback.

Looking to start making a 3rd-party module now? Let us know now! Although thorough documentation for that process doesn't currently exist, we'd love to start figuring it out with you.

The more people interested in helping with development, the more development we can plan.

Thank you for being a part of the **CitrineOS** community! Together, we'll make this project better every day.
